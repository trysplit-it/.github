## `splitit-main`

#### The main repo for our project. It's written in the MERN stack, and it's what you see when you go to our website.

## `splitit-ios`

#### The repo for our ios deployment. It's written in Swift, and it's what you see when you download our app from the app store.

## `docs`

#### The place to go to answer your questions. If you have a question, go here first, then bring it to someone. This is maintained by all of us, so if there are any significant new features/functions/tech stack that you think other people will benefit from reading about, put it here. Tutorials and such are also in this repo.

## `.github`

#### This repo manages the README that you are seeing now! Nothing else to it.
